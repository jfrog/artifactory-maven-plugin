# Maven Artifactory plugin

The Maven Artifactory integrates in your build to allow you to do the following:

## Using Maven Artifactory plugin

## Building the sources
To build the plugin sources, please follow these steps:
1. Clone the code from Git.
2. Install the plugin by running the following Maven command:
```
mvn clean install
```

## Testing the plugin
* If you'd like to run the plugin's tests, run the following commands:
```
mvn clean install
mvn verify -DskipITs=false
```
The above command run both unit and integration tests.

* In order to remote debug the integration tests, add `debugITs=true` property to the test command and add a break point in your IDE:
```
mvn clean install
mvn verify -DskipITs=false -DdebugITs=true
```
After running the above command, you should start a remote debugging session on port 5005 and wait until the code reaches the break point.
